TODO

Writing Level class
	- Loading obstacles narrow hitbox form config
	- Load chips/ludd from a map
	- Add multi-layered background (lights man, lights!)

Fade out projectiles/ludd

Implement states on the boss dishrag
	- Ask if we should implement random intervals on boss stopping 

Make sure luddis doesnt move use mouseposition when they are equal (zero vector does not give pleasant results)
	- Make sure luddis loads in the correct position (rotation)
	- Give luddis a direction vector, and use that to give him a default rotation, and maybe use it combined with prevpos, to do collision better?
Implement a music queue for starting with an intro, and moving on to looping music

Check that my math for checking gaps in SAT is correct / not redundant
Align the collision check to the actual shape

Do we really need separate classes for dust/chips
	
Implementing states in gamemanager
Maybe reading masks/maps by using sf::Image.getPixelPtr()

?? - 	Entity-component-system
	- Skriva en lista med beteenden, och en lista med data som behövs, i Luddis
	- Konvertera listan med data till primitiva datatyper (dubletter hanteras senare)
	- 

Generally assert pre-requirements (zeropointer etc). DbC

What represents me? Moving obstacle in "Städskrub".

Maybe start using doxygen for future sprints/iterations
Maybe implement some kind of entity component system? Test it on a separate branch?



LOG

26/1/16
Started working on EventManager. Implementing Observerpattern.
Went home
Implemented states. Finished eventmanager. Moved Björns luddis code from main, to the gamemanager. confirmed eventmanager works. Did some small fixes and comments around the code

27/1/16
Helped debugging projectile and entitymanager. Started working on Level. 
LUNCH
Problem with filters occured, had to manually recreate all filters.
Continued work on Level class. Focusing on implementing sf::View.
Implemented the Luddis sprite (unfinished) to replace the placeholder sprite. Had to do some changes to the rotation of luddis to make it face the right way according to the sprite. Rotation is now based of a front vector, which is easily changed.

28/1/16
Fixed scaling of the view, and mouse coords mapping to the new scale. Helped implementing renderlayers, sorting still doesn't work, helped move rendering into entitymanager.
LUNCH
Continued working on scaling the resolution. 
Went home.
Continued working on scaling, put that away after a while. 
Started working on animation.
Finished animation. Added icon to game.

29/1/16
Fixing luddis hitbox after animation. Not done.
Started writing simple debug (draw shapes, write to console/log)

30/1/16
Fixed res scaling problem, just setting the views' initial size solved it.
Added the ability to listen to a specific event, if you're interested in all its' eventtypes. Scrapped that idea.
Made rendersorting dynamic (now we just need to add new renderlayers in entity if we need more).
Trying to fix rendering problem (Issue #9). 

1/2/16
Tried fixing audio. Audio was using 24 sample format, sfml only supports 16 bit.
coninued fixing luddis hitbox. We need to transform the entity instead of the sprite
Went home
Fixed scrolling the view.
Started looking at how to set up YAML or JSON library

2/2/16
Fixed bug where audio didn't work in release mode.
Avstämning
Started working on an animationqueue. 
LUNCH
Finished animationqueue.
Went home
Working on seminar questions. Started looking at json parsing.
--> Don't forget Seminariefrågor and planering! <--

3/2/16
Started implementing json configs.
Implemented vertical scrolling.
Implemented loading animation from metadata.
Fixed soundengine not handling musicvolume properly.
Started implementing narrow collision. Will just make basic hitboxes for now, and implementing draw hitboxes. Not done, continuing tomorrow.

4/2/16
PLANERING!!!
Fixed animation.
Continued on narrow collision
Created projection function to vectormath

5/2/16
Continued working on collision
Writing plan for project

6/2/16
Helg / Lagat bilen

7/2/16

8/2/16
Helped björn with JSON.
continued working on SAT, solved a problem with projection, getting the scalar.
Johanna showed a bug with the animation

9/2/16
Got the idea that the collision is not working because the points on the shape is not transformed => both shapes are on same standard position => they're colliding

10/2/16
Projection sorting min wasnt working

11/2/16
added checks for zero-vectors in normaliaztion of vectors, and fixed places where we tried noramlizing zero-vecors
opitimzing animationqueue
optimized rotating by 90 (getting normal in narrow collision) by adding getNormal function that just return (-y, x)

14/2/16
Tested porting Luddis to Linux (Luddis + Linux = Luddux?)

15/2/16
Added defaultvalue to loadTexture
Adding loading of json files to the resourcemanager. Saving the json files in memory.
