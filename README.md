Luddis
==============
Repository for our game project.

I did not include the SFML files in this repo. You've got to download them yourself and put them into the luddis_project folder. 
You also need to copy the files to your debug folder (where the .exe is located):
- openal32.dll
- sfml-audio-2.dll
- sfml-audio-d-2.dll
- sfml-graphics-2.dll
- sfml-graphics-d-2.dll
- sfml-window-2.dll
- sfml-window-d-2.dll
- sfml-system-2.dll
- sfml-system-d-2.dll


Download SFML 2.3.2 for visual c++ 12 32-bit if you're using Visual studio 2013.
